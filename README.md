# Technical Test

This project is a complete CRUD application for managing products using **Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript**, **React Query**, **React Hook Form**, **Zod** for validation, and **TailwindCSS** for styling.  
It consumes the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com) and follows a clean architecture, separating data access, hooks, and UI components.  

The application includes:  
- Login screen (fake login)  
- Product listing  
- Product details  
- Product creation, editing, and deletion  
- User feedback and a responsive interface
